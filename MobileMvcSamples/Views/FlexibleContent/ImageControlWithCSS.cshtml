    <p>This picture is 600 pixels in width but sizes flexibly within its containing HTML element
      because it is set to 100% max-width in CSS.
    </p>
    <img src="~/content/images/bookshelf.jpg" />

    <p>This is the easiest way to make your images flexible across various screen sizes but doesn't
      solve the problem of sending too much image to devices that can't display them completely.
      Wasted bandwidth is a sad thing sometimes.
